      <p class="info">This tutorial deals with giving your NPC some general script additions like XP adjustment upon joining, removing of Story Mode upon leaving the group, letting the NPC move in cutscenes if not in party, and inclusion into general NPC reaction points to the main game events.</p>
	  <p class="info">The listed situations in this tutorial are the ones where general reactions depending on class, race, or alignment of all or several NPCs in group are included in the game and where a mod NPC should not be missing. It does not give examples of possible interjection points depending on individual NPCs' character or personal reactions to game events etc.</p>
	  <p class="info">The tutorial now includes all instances I could find by browsing the game files. Let me know if I missed anything or if you have general critique. The tutorial might change after I finished my own NPC mods for SoD.</p>

	  <h2><a name="toc_1">1. Some general script additions</a></h2>
      <p>This chapter presents script additions every NPC in SoD has in their OVERRIDE script. They are for XP adjustment upon joining in SoD, total healing and dispell of effects after leaving the Ducal Palace, and removing of Story Mode if leaving the party.</p> 
      <p>The first eight script blocks deal with levelling the NPC up to match the XP the PC has in SoD. This is especially interesting if your NPC was left standing in BG:EE and is supposed to rejoin the group now, or for a new SoD game if they will join later in SoD where the PC had time to level up. It also gives the possibility to use one cre file for both new BG:EE and SoD games without having to think about how to distribute weapon pips etc. (Maybe not as smart for a mage or cleric etc. who need to know higher level spells in SoD, though.)</p> 
	  <p>The next script block contains full healing and dispelling of any spell effects, deafness, feeblemindedness etc. after Korlasz' Crypt is cleared.</p> 
	  <p>The last script block will remove the Story Mode from your NPC if they leave the party.</p> 
	  <p>You could put these into an own .baf-file and EXTEND_BOTTOM it to your NPC's SoD OVERRIDE script.</p> 
	<pre class="code">

    <p>This is for NPCs the player takes into the group before leaving for the crusade. In the game, all original NPCs recruitable in BG city, i.e. Minsc, Dynaheir, and Safana, have a comment in the morning after the last night in the Ducal Palace, after Skie woke up the PC. For this, those three NPCs are moved into the PC's bed chamber by bdcut05.bcs which is triggered by Skie's dialgogue bdskie.dlg. Multiplayer NPCs (or mod NPCs without an addition) will be standing in the hall between the PC's and Imoen's chambers.</p> 
	<p>The actual moving of the party NPCs is done by bdcut05.bcs, but it is scripted in a way that patching it neither at top nor bottom will move mod NPCs in time.

      <p>When the PC leaves the Ducal Palace, ready to march against the crusade, all NPCs and relevant coalition leaders (from BG) are gathered in front of the Entrance, along with a cheerful crowd. The area is now bd0101.are.</p> 
      <p>The NPCs not in the group have random DisplaystringHeads while they are waiting for the PC either to talk to them or to Corwin and start the march.

Note: we already used the name "bd0101_patch.baf" for Biff's spawning as described in Tutorial Part 1, so we will name this file "bd0101_commenting_et.baf", with "_et" for "EXTEND_TOP".</p>

		  <h2><a name="toc_killsp">9. PC killed Crusaders using the Spikes Trap in Temple of Bhaal (good aligned NPCs)</a></h2>
	  <p>Inside the old temple of Bhaal (bd7230.are) there are three crusaders trapped in cages. A lever to the left will activate a spike trap in those cages, killing the three crusaders inside. The PC can either activate the trap by clicking on the lever twice. Before doing that, the PC can also threaten the crusaders with doing this.</p>
	  <p class="info">If the lever is pulled twice and the crusaders killed that way, a PC being PALADIN or RANGER will fall. Please note: because of how it is scripted, clicking on the lever while having more than one group member selected is counted by the engine as more than one click - and the spike trapp will be activated even if the player clicked only once!</p>
	  <p>If the PC choses the threatening reply option it is only Rasaad who will react to the threat (and Dorn replying to Rasaad if present). But seeing how using the lever to kill the crusaders will lead to a fall of paladin- and rangerhood of the PC tells me that this is a situation where good aligned NPCs should react, and strongly.<p>
	  <p>So, Biff will do three things to serve as an example for other mod NPCs:<p>
	  <ol>
        <li>Biff will comment on the threat in the crusader's dialogue (BDKHARMY.dlg state 6).</li>
        <li>Biff will have a comment as floating text in case the spike trap is activated to kill the crusaders.</li>
        <li>Biff will have a comment as dialogue box in case the PC loses paladin or rangerhood this way.</li>
	  </ol>	  
	  <p>The comment into the dialogue is a simple I_C_T that needs to be put into a .d-file. In the tutorial mod package it is called <strong>sod_event_comments.d</strong>:<p>	  
	 <pre class="code">

	  <p>In chapter 9, the PC has the opportunity to hand over Bridgefort to the crusaders without a fight. Good aligned NPCs in the party will call this a betrayal. First, Corwin will speak up, then Khalid. Neera, Rasaad, Dynaheir, and Minsc will chime in depending on the PC's replies, and finally Jaheira.</p>	 
      <p>If Corwin is not in the party, the dialogue will be started by Khalid and the other NPCs will chime in as described. If Khalid is not in the party, then Jaheira, Minsc, and Rasaad will have their dialogue lines as DisplayStringHeads, instead.</p>
	  <p>So, we want two things for Biff: if Khalid is in the group and able to talk, we want Biff to say his comment after Khalid's first line. If Khalid is not able to talk, Biff should have his comment as a floating text above his head - but after Corwin spoke her line if she is in party and able to talk.</p>
	  <p>To achieve this, we need to consider the following: 	  	    
	  <ol>
        <li>The text line will be the same in both cases, but one will go into Biff's joined dialogue xxBiffJ.dlg and one into the area script bd2000.bcs.</li>
        <li>And, for the I_C_T into Khalid's joined dialogue BDKHALIJ.dlg we use the same global variable name than we will for the DisplayStringHead in the script.</li>

This is done in a way that either one NPC of each of the two groups will speak randomly, and only if this didn't happen (because the NPC in question is not in party), each one of the NPCs are called in extra script blocks directly in case the random script blocks didn't trigger.</p>

     <h2><a name="toc_21">24. Avernus: Thrix' Game</a></h2>
	 <p>In Avernus in front of the great door to the great endboss a fiend names Thrix will want to play a game with the PC: he gets a soul from either one of the group members if the PC loses, and the PC gets a weapon if saying the correct answer.</p>	
	 <p>To determine which NPC Thrix proposes for taking the soul, the dialogue pretends a certain randomness which we will try to preserve with our addition for our NPC. Since the chosing of the NPC(s) is not done with real randomness, what we will do is add our NPC to each of the 4 corresponding dialogue blocks with which the randomness is simulated.</p>	
	 <p>To be precise, we will add our NPC to the bottom of the first, the top of the second, at position 10 of the third and position 5 of the 4<sup>th</sup>. This way, it will not be our NPC that gets chosen every time and the outcome is somewhat unpredictable, which gives enough credit to how Thix' dialogue is coded.</p> 
	 <p>This tutorial shows the standard case: Thrix will chose our NPC, the PC can either accept, request that Thrix choses another, offer their own soul, or attack. If our NPC is chosen and the PC accepts, there will be a follow-up dialogue of our NPC.</p>
	 <p class="info">Of course, there can be other possibilities as well: Thrix can first ponder your NPC but then decide not to take them himself, and the NPC can also react to the PC offering his own soul etcpp. Feel free to expand on the example, as always.</p>
	 <p>The variable Global("xxBiff_SoDThrix","GLOBAL") is used as follows. We do not need all the variants for what we do in this tutorial, but this way, you have all you need to let your NPC react to all outcomes.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Global("xxBiff_SoDThrix","GLOBAL",0): Biff was not chosen in Thrix' game.</li>
        <li>Global("xxBiff_SoDThrix","GLOBAL",1): Biff was chosen and the PC accepted it, but either won the game [there is a game variable to detect that, see below] or tried to fight the demon off after losing.</li>
        <li>Global("xxBiff_SoDThrix","GLOBAL",2): Biff was chosen but PC requested that Thrix should chose another.</li>
        <li>Global("xxBiff_SoDThrix","GLOBAL",3): Biff was chosen but the PC offered their own soul instead.</li>
        <li>Global("xxBiff_SoDThrix","GLOBAL",4): Biff was chosen before the riddle and the PC sent him off to Thrix (verbally) after losing.</li>
        <li>Global("xxBiff_SoDThrix","GLOBAL",5): Biff was chosen but the PC decided to fight the demon before the riddle.</li>
      </ol> 
	 <p>There are the following variables we can use and track in the game:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Global("BD_Thrix_riddle_won","GLOBAL",1): PC won the riddle.</li>
        <li>Global("bd_thrix_sacrifice_companion","global",1): PC offered/accepted an NPC's soul.</li>

      <h2><a name="toc_22">25. Training the Recruits in the Coalition Camp</a></h2>
	  <p>In the big coalition camp bd3000.are, there are six recruits where the PC and specific NPCs can help with their training: Clovis, Danine, Garrold, Hester, Morlis, and Taield. For most cases this is done by reply options with which the PC can ask NPCs for their help. The original reply options featuring this usually go along the lines of "npcname, do you have something to say?" with the exception of Morlis and Danine as described below.<br /> 
	  Possibilities to contribute is depending on the NPC's class or race: </p>
	  
	  <ol>
        <li>Clovis (bdclovis.dlg) can best be helped by one of the "small" races, as he is dwarf himself. He gets advice to go for the knees and joints instead of the (higher up) armored regions of his opponents.<br />
		"Don't try to fight like a big one. Hitting up wears you out." (M'Khiin).<br />
		"You want to stab at the enemy's torso. A natural instinct, I understand it—but it's not as effective as it could be, and I'm guessing it's hard on the arms, right?" (Glint).</li>
        <li>Danine (bddanine.dlg) can best be helped by a thief. Her agility and showing her how to surprise her opponents (i.e. to fight "dirty") are her strengths. Safana will interject with her advice after the PC gave theirs. For compatibility reasons, I suggest to add reply options to ask an appropriate NPC for their advice directly. <br />
		"If you don't mind, I think I can teach the private some tricks. You've got the right idea, but you're not taking it far enough." (Safana).<br />
        <li>Garrold (bdgarrol.dlg) is best helped by a mage, by noticing that he better join the battle mages because he likes to learn and memorize patterns.<br />
		"This young man seems more intelligent than most. Allow me to look at thine aura, soldier... I see much potential in thy abilities. Perhaps thou shouldst train with magic instead of steel." (Dynaheir).<br />
		"It's obvious this weakling is no soldier. I've eaten chickens with thicker legs than his. He seems moderately intelligent, though. Get him into mage training. He may be of use some day." (Edwin).</li>
        <li>A bard or cleric or a PC with WIS greater 10 can help Hester (bdhester.dlg). Hester is extremely anxious and needs help to overcome his fears. For some reason, some general advice à la "overcome your fear and you will feel better" is all he needs to hear, which is readily given even by Viconia if asked: "Everyone fears death, young one. It's the natural state of mortals. Shar teaches that it's foolish to chase hope or plan overmuch for the future. Death comes to all of us in the end. It's what we do in the moment that matters. - Life is loss. In the end, we lose our lives. Accept that truth and move forward." (Viconia).<br />
		"Pain hurts, but it makes you stronger. Fear death and you'll never really live. - I just said that. You do it now." (M'Khiin).</li>
        <li>Morlis (bdmorlis.dlg) can best be helped by a barbarian or blackguard. The trick is to realize that he has fun in killing and encourage him to do so. A (not evil aligned) barbarian can also notice his rage in battle and stress its positive purposes in war. This is the second recruit where the PC does not ask an NPC whether they have any advice / seem like they want to say something but where Dorn will interject after the PC's own advice. For compatibility reasons, I suggest to add reply options to ask an appropriate NPC for their advice directly.<br />
		"I sense something in you, soldier. A darkness that reminds me of my own. You like killing, don't you?" (Dorn).</li>
        <li>Taield (BDTAIELD.dlg) can best be helped by a fighter or a half-elf like him. For some reason his being half-elf makes him feel different to the normal recruits and somewhat alienated to the cause of the coalition. A half-elf NPC or NPCs with such experiences can address these feelings of lonlyness to help him identify with the group and the war in total. A fighter can just give him intensive sparring, which will also help.<br />
		"I have never been a soldier, but I know what it is to be different. I was raised by druids, not by my parents, and often felt alone. - Everyone has a reason to feel alone. We each make our own paths and fight for our own causes. You must find the strength within to endure, as do we all." (Jaheira).</li>
      </ol>
	  <p>For simplification of the example, Biff will just give everyone good advice which I partly took from my NPC mods because I'm lazy. He's the Understudy, after all!</p> 
		  <p>It is convenient to use the existent reply options for the 6 recruits. To account for EET compatibility we need to consider that all BG1+SoD string reference numbers in EET are higher by 200,000, meaning the sring reference #48085 in SoD will be #248085 in EET. Put this into the ALWAYS block of the tp2 so existing string reference numbers can be used for BG:SoD and EET in one go, by adding %2% in front of the string number.</p>
		  <p class="info">Note: this works although the defined "2" is a string, not a number. There might be instances where this syntax will not work like it does here, e.g. for journal titles in ADD_JOURNAL in the tp2. Also, only adding a "2" only works for SoD strings that all have at least 5 digits. For smaller numbers from BG1 there would be additional zeros missing.</p>

      <h2><a name="toc_24">27. Providing the "Skipit" Functionality for Cutscenes</a></h2>
	  <p>I made this an extra How-To and will only give a link here: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/35020-how-to-using-ees-skipit-functionality-for-mod-cutscenes/">[How-To] Using EE's "Skipit" Functionality for Mod Cutscenes </a></p>
	  
	
	       <h2><a name="toc_12b">28. Make the Mod EET compatible</a></h2>
      <p>The depth of what is required for your mod to be EET compatible depends strongly on what your mod will cover. If your NPC is also available in BG:EE, then the naming differences of most BG1 resources (those files that needed renaming because BGII has different files of the same name) require the use of OUTER_SPRINT variables as defined in the widely used cpmvars.tpas for e.g. area names, Imoen's scriptname, or some cre file names. The principle of this multi-platform coding is described in cmorgan's tutorial <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/10003-crossing-the-great-divide/?page=1">Crossing the Great Divide</a>. k4thos made a list about different naming conventions <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/K4thos/EET/master/EET/docs/BG1%20reference%20table.html">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>If looking "only" at SoD, there is the huge advantage that most resources didn't need to be renamed as SoD already uses unique file names and almost all resources are the same for SoD(BG:EE) and SoD(EET). One exception is Imoen's death variable: it is "IMOEN" in SoD and "IMOEN2" in EET. And of course using string reference numbers need to be toggled: the EET numbers are the BG:SoD ones plus 200,000. One example how to unify this is given <a href="#toc_22">in Chapter 25: Training the Recruits in the Coalition Camp</a>.</p> 
	  <p>Then the only question is whether the NPC will be available in BGII, too (and whether you realize this by a continuous NPC that has the same script variable (death name) in BGII, also), or whether the NPC should not be available if the player continuous into BGII after finishing SoD in EET.</p>
	  <p>EET offers a very comfortable function to provide your NPC mod with all needed script additions etc. for the transitions BG1 -&gt; SoD, SoD -&gt; SoA, and SoA -&gt; ToB. The function is called EET_NPC_TRANSITION and there is a very detailed description how to use it and what it does in the according <a href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/K4thos/EET/master/EET/docs/Modder's Notes.html">Modder Notes</a> (It is well possible the link will not work because of the apostroph in it. Here is the address for copy&paste: https://cdn.rawgit.com/K4thos/EET/master/EET/docs/Modder's Notes.html.)</p>
	  <p>Biff is supposed to be an SoD NPC, so the mod would be category "1" (BG:EE/SoD NPC). The needed parameters for the function would be the following. Put this late into the <strong>tp2-file</strong>, at least after your NPC's script file compilation:</p>
	  <pre class="code">
/* EET compatibility: Biff is an BG1 (SoD) NPC only. His name will be mentioned on EET's fate spirit in ToB, but he will not be summonable (like all NPCs that didn't join the group in BGII). */

  END
END	  
	  </pre>
	  <p>For Biff being an SoD mod only, this is basically it. The transition from SoD to SoA in EET is done by K#TELBGT.bcs which lets all NPCs that are not multiplayer characters leave the party. The EET_NPC_TRANSITION will add a DestroySelf() to Biff's OVERRIDE script if the chapter (of the continuous EET chapter system) hits chapter 14. So, we do not need to add anything to make sure he will not be present in BGII.</p>

For players, it aims to make the coalition forces aware of Caelar's and Hephernaan's plans with focus on the actual important aim and danger of the crusade, and give reply options with which the PC can inform the coalition forces about what is going on. For this, all bits and pieces of information the PC can gather along the campaign are tracked and evaluated. Journal entries give an overview on what information the PC already gathered.</br>
	  For modders, "Road to Discovery" introduces a variable-based tracking system about the different levels of knowledge the PC and the coalition officers gain throughout the campaign, which could be used for own mods, e.g. for fine tuning mod NPCs reactions to the depths of gained information about Caelar, Hephernaan, and the crusade, but also the Hooded Man's appearances.</p>
	  <p>The mod is modular so every player as well as modder can chose how much changes and content they want to see/use. If only the second component of the mod is installed (the "main" component), only the variable tracking system will be installed - the player will see no difference while playing the game.</p>
	  <p>For your own NPC mod, feel invited to use the tracking system of "Road to Discovery" to fine-tune your NPC's reactions to game events. I developped it for exactly that purpose - my own NPC mods - and a lot of effort was put into the tracking system and the different stages of tracked PC's knowledge.</p> 
	  <p>The following lists the information from the SoD campaign "Road to Discovery" is considering. For detailed description of the used variables and the exact definition of the tracked infomation see inside the mod packge:</p>
	  
	  <ol>
        <li>What is the main purpose of the crusade - what is Caelar proclaiming, and what is it really?</li>
        <li>What truth lies in Caelar's proclamation - and her crusaders' belief - that Caelar protects the crusade with "divine powers of the pantheon"?</li>
        <li>What is the background of Caelar's life and family, and how does it influence her motives?</li>
        <li>Is Caelar a Bhaal Spawn?</li>
        <li>Caelar is being betrayed? By who?</li>
        <li>What are Hephernaan's plans?</li>
        <li>The Hooded Man is stalking the PC, and why?</li>
        <li>What does Caelar and Hephernaan want with the PC?</li>
        <li>What was the attack in the palace with the weak poison for?</li>
